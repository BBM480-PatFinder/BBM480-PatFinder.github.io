						<h4 style="font-family: Consolas,serif"><strong>Problem Introduction</strong></h4>
                        <p style="font-family: Consolas,serif">Introducing our cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence Based Patent Search System, designed to revolutionize the way researchers and innovators navigate the ever-expanding landscape of patents. With record-breaking numbers of patent applications filed worldwide each year, efficiently searching through this vast resource has become a critical challenge. Our system leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing and information retrieval techniques, specifically tailored for the complex language used in patents. By utilizing a domain-specific language model, PatentSBERTa, our system outperforms traditional methods and delivers highly accurate and relevant search results. Experience the future of patent search with our AI-driven solution, saving you time and effort in your research and innovation process.</p>

						<h4 style="font-family: Consolas,serif"><strong>Solution Methodology</strong></h4>
                        <p style="font-family: Consolas,serif">Our Artificial Intelligence Based Patent Search System employs a sophisticated approach to ensure the most accurate and relevant results. We begin by curating a custom dataset of patent documents, focusing on the top 100 companies in the aerospace industry. The text data undergoes rigorous pre-processing, including translation to English, removal of incomplete patents, and cleaning of irrelevant characters and figures. We then employ PatentSBERTa, a transformer model specifically trained on patent data, to convert the text into high-dimensional vector representations. These vectors capture the semantic meaning and relationships between concepts within the patents using attention mechanisms. ElasticSearch, a powerful vector database, enables efficient vector-based search, while a KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm with cosine similarity is used to retrieve the most relevant patents. This technical foundation allows our system to excel at handling real-world queries, synthetic queries created by language models, and even patent research reports prepared by experts.</p>
