                <p>Dataset: This is the starting point of the process and likely refers to a collection of patent documents that need to be searched. The dataset is represented as a 'Document'.

Translate API: The patent documents in the dataset are passed through a translation API. This step suggests that the documents may be in different languages, and the API standardizes them into a single language to simplify processing.

Sentence Transformer: The translated documents are processed by a sentence transformer. This machine learning model is designed to convert sentences into vector representations. Sentence transformers are particularly useful for capturing the semantic meanings of sentences, which helps in improving the accuracy of search results.

Vectorized Content: The output from the sentence transformer is a vectorized representation of each document in the dataset. These vectors are ready for comparison and search operations.

Query: This is the input from a user who is searching for specific information within the patent dataset. The query is represented as 'Data (I/O)', indicating that it is an input/output entity in the system.

Sentence Transformer (again): The user's query is also processed by the same sentence transformer used for the dataset. This ensures that the query is converted into a vector form that is compatible with the vectorized content of the dataset.

Vectorized Query: The transformed query becomes a vectorized form, which can now be compared directly against the vectorized content of the dataset.

Elasticsearch: This is a search engine that facilitates the searching of documents. Here, it likely uses the vectorized query to search through the vectorized content. Elasticsearch is known for its powerful full-text search capabilities and, in this setup, it may be configured to handle vector-based searching.

KNN with Cosine Similarity: This step indicates the use of a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm combined with cosine similarity to find the most relevant patent documents. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, which in this case, are the vectorized query and the vectorized document contents. This measure is used to identify the documents that are most similar to the query.

Related Results: The final output of the process is the related results that are returned to the user based on the query. These results are likely ranked by their relevance to the query, determined by the cosine similarity scores.</p>
